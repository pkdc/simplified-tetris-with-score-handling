# tetris
This project is using JavaScript, without using Canvas, to make a game of tetris.

This repo contains the initial pieces of code for the features that I was responsible for, or trying to implement in a greater group project to build the tetris game.
The group project main code is in a course private repo.

(Optional) Implement a go API service that allows saving the score data from the game in JSON format.

I used js modules, and then bundle them together with Parcel.
Then I served the resulting bundle as Go template in the experimental branch.

Note: This project is not finished yet.
