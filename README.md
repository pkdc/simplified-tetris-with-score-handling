# Tetris
This project is using Vanilla JavaScript to make a game of Tetris (without using Canvas).


simplified-tetris:

This repo contains the initial pieces of code for the features that I was responsible for in a greater group project to build the Tetris game.
The group project main code is in a course private repo.


score-handling:

In addition, I was responsible to implement a RESTful API service with Go, the client can save the data (POST), and request it (GET). This service will store the information of each play (name, score, and time) in JSON format and return all the information when requested. 

Controls:
Press Spacebar to begin the game, the Tetris block will start falling

Press ESC to end the game and display an input form, after submitting the form, a leaderboard will appear

Press arrow left and right to move the Tetris block sideways

Press arrow down to accelerate the fall of the Tetris block
