# tetris
This project is using Vanilla JavaScript to make a game of tetris (without using Canvas).

This repo contains the initial pieces of code for the features that I was responsible for in a greater group project to build the tetris game.
The group project main code is in a course private repo.

In addition, I was responsible to implement a RESTful API service with Go, the client can save the data (POST), and request it (GET). This service will store the information of each play (name, score, and time) in JSON format and return all the information when requested. 

Note: This project is not finished yet.
